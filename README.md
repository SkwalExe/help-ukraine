# Help Ukraine 🇺🇦
for several weeks, putin's war against russia has been killing thousands of people, you would like to help them but you tell yourself that on your scale as a simple citizen you can do nothing, each contribution, no matter how small, is useful, that's why I created the help-ukraine project.

This is a simple program that you can run in the background on your computer, which will DDOS the Russian government site, the site's average response time is already over 3382ms, which is very slow. If a sufficient number of people launch the program simultaneously, the site may no longer work, which would already be a step forward in deterring Putin from continuing the war.
